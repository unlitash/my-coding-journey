    <h1>HELLO THERE :)</h1>
    I'm Ashkan the creator of this website. here is a brief explanation about everything:<br> this website is my very first one and I'm aiming to make it somewhat a digital portfolio for myself.<br>
containing the HTML/CSS basics and basic functionality which are brought to the website by Java sript or Python, this website gives me both the opportunity to practice on my coding skills and improving my portfolio as a junior developer.
creating a website which is useful, good looking, userfriendly and fun is what makes me interested in web designing.
